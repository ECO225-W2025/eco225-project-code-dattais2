    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to academic achievement, especially when measured by test scores, two major concerns arise in discussions of education inequality: discrepancies by race, and discrepancies by wealth. One study in particular - Dixon-Rom√ÅN et. al (2013) - examined the relationship between race, income, and academic performance on the U.S.'s standardized Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT). They found, somewhat unsurprisingly, a positive relationship between income and SAT performance. But there was also a gap between white and black student performance at every income level.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a lot of interpretations on where that racial disparity comes from, with many researchers identify sociocultural contexts to race that correlate with academic outcomes. Osborne (1997) observes a sense of \"academic disidentification\" that is seen as a response to negative racial stereotypes, while Carter (2016) explores a case study recognizing social dynamics within school creating race-based academic disparities, even with similar socioeconomic backgrounds. Farkas (2004) argues that differences in academic inclination emerge due to differences in how black and white kids are raised before entering school.\n",
    "\n",
    "Students' socioeconomic advantages may have can be broadly divided into two categories: advantages from school, and advantages from home. Both types of advantages conceivably could influence academic performance, but the relationship between these two types of advantages adds another layer of nuance. Wodtke et. al (2023) suggests that these two types of advantages don't meaningfully overlap, so it may be meaningful to conduct analysis with both types of factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, I use data for the 2018-2019 school year. I use the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) Public Schools Characteristics 2018-19 dataset as my primary catalog of U.S. public schools. My supplementary datasets are the Stanford Education Data Archive (SEDA) 2023, the District Costs Database (DCD) 2024, and the American Community Survey (ACS) 2019 data 5-Year Estimate S1901 dataset."

    "## Data Loading and Cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the datasets mentioned in the introduction, we select variables to use in our analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our main independent \"X\" variable is race - more specifically, racial distributions by school, which can primarily be denoted by the white population %. Our main dependent \"Y\" variable is academic performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our other control \"X\" variables take into account economic factors from the school and outside it. School factors include student-to-teacher ratio and school spending per student, while our out-of-school factor is family income.\n",
    "\n",
    "One variable that falls somewhere in between is the % of free and reduced lunch students, since that is partly a result of a lack of family income but also partially reflective of the school's ability to financially support these students.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the economic advantages we want to analyze, we choose a few variables: student-to-teacher ratio, absolute and relative spending on students, and household income by race.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first variable - student-to-teacher ratio - is chosen to account for the intuitive notion that students in lower studen-to-teacher ratio schools will tend to perform better academically due to more personal attention. The next two variables are to account for economic advantages provided to students by the school - since certain school districts have more money and resources than others. It's important, however, to have both absolute and relative costs per student, since the amount of money a student needs need not be constant across the U.S. To address this, the DCD database also provides a predicted cost per student to have an adequete education, which we can use as a relative comparison to absolute spending per student. Including both absolute and relative spending on students allows for more meaningful insights. Finally, we have income values by race to account for differences in economic advantages at home. It intuitively follows that higher household income leads to higher academic performance due to the extra time, money and resources higher income households can often funnel towards a child's education.\n",
